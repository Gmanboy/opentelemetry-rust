//! # OpenTelemetry SDK
//!
//! This SDK provides an opinionated reference implementation of
//! the OpenTelemetry API. The SDK implements the specifics of
//! deciding which data to collect through `Sampler`s, and
//! facilitates the delivery of telemetry data to storage systems
//! through `Exporter`s. These can be configured on `Tracer` and
//! `Meter` creation.
